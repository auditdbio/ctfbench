The vulnerability in this contract arises from the unbounded loop in the distribute() function. As the number of participants increases, the loop may require more gas than what is available in a single transaction, leading to an out-of-gas error. This gas exhaustion can effectively block the distribution process, resulting in a denial-of-service condition where tokens are not distributed to participants.
