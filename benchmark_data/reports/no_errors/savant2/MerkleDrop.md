## 📝 Disclaimer


This AI-powered audit by Savant.Chat is based on the smart contract code at the time of evaluation; 
any subsequent changes may require re-auditing. Due to AI limitations, such as potential hallucination, 
the audit may not detect all issues, and findings—especially fix recommendations—should be reviewed by 
a security specialist. Users are advised to implement additional checks like manual reviews and regular 
re-audits. The AI auditor is provided "as is," and neither Savant.Chat, nor its developers, nor its 
providers, shall be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential 
damages arising from its use or reliance on its results. Users must independently verify findings and 
assume all risks, as the AI may produce incorrect information.
