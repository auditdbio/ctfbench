## 🚨 Issue 1

### 📄 File: `Voting.sol`

### Issue Code Highlight

```solidity
    function vote() external {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted");

        uint256 power = votingPowerContract.votingPower(msg.sender);
        require(power > 0, "No voting power");

        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        totalVotes += power;

        emit VoteCast(msg.sender, power);
    }
```

### Synopsis

The voting system allows token double-counting through transfer-after-voting attacks. Voting power is checked dynamically without snapshots, enabling malicious actors to reuse the same tokens across multiple voters, artificially inflating `totalVotes` and bypassing quorum requirements.

### Technical Details

The vulnerability stems from:
1. Dynamic voting power checks without token locking/snapshots
2. Per-address vote tracking instead of token-based tracking
3. Cumulative `totalVotes` that doesn't account for token movements

Attack flow:
1. Attacker votes with maximum voting power
2. Transfers tokens to a new address
3. Votes again with same tokens through new address
4. Repeats to accumulate fake voting power in `totalVotes`

This violates the core voting invariant of "1 token = 1 vote" by allowing the same tokens to be counted multiple times through sequential transfers and votes from fresh addresses.

### Proof of Concept

1. Deploy Voting contract with quorum = 100
2. Alice obtains 100 voting tokens
3. Alice votes → totalVotes = 100 (quorum met)
4. Alice transfers 100 tokens to Bob
5. Bob votes → totalVotes = 200
6. executeProposal() succeeds with inflated total

Same tokens counted twice despite only 100 existing tokens.

### Impact Assessment

**Critical Severity**
- Allows unlimited vote amplification
- Renders quorum checks meaningless
- Enables proposal execution without legitimate support
- Compromises entire governance mechanism
- Requires only basic token transfer functionality to exploit

### Remediation

**Immediate Fix:**  
Modify constructor to take a snapshot of voting powers:

```solidity
// In Voting contract
mapping(address => uint256) public votingPowerSnapshot;

constructor(...) {
    // Add:
    votingPowerSnapshot[msg.sender] = IVotingPower(_votingPowerContract).votingPower(msg.sender);
}

function vote() external {
    require(votingPowerSnapshot[msg.sender] > 0, "No snapshotted power");
    // Use snapshot instead of live query
    uint256 power = votingPowerSnapshot[msg.sender];
    // Rest remains same
}
```

**Recommended Solution:**  
1. Take voting power snapshot at proposal creation
2. Store individual voter allocations
3. Prevent token transfers during voting period
