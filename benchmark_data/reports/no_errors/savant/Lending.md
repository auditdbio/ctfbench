## 🚨 Issue 1

### 📄 File: `Lending.sol`

### Original Code
```solidity
function getCurrentDebt(address borrower) public view returns (uint256) {
    Loan memory loan = loans[borrower];
    if (loan.principal == 0) return 0;
    uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - loan.startTime;
    uint256 scale = 1e18;

    uint256 x = (INTEREST_RATE_PER_SECOND * timeElapsed) / scale;
    
    uint256 x2 = (x * x) / scale;
    uint256 x3 = (x2 * x) / scale;
    
    uint256 expApprox = scale + x + (x2 / 2) + (x3 / 6);
    
    return (loan.principal * expApprox) / scale;
}
```

### Synopsis
The interest calculation in `getCurrentDebt` uses premature division, truncating small values to zero. This allows borrowers to repay loans without paying interest, risking protocol insolvency through interest-free flash loans. Critical arithmetic vulnerability affecting debt accrual.

### Technical Details
The vulnerability stems from improper scaling in Taylor series approximation. `x = (INTEREST_RATE_PER_SECOND * timeElapsed) / 1e18` truncates to zero for durations <10 years due to division before multiplication. This forces all interest terms (x, x²/2, x³/6) to zero, resulting in no interest accrual. Debt remains equal to principal regardless of elapsed time.

### Proof of Concept
1. Borrow 100 tokens with collateral
2. Repay immediately in same block (`timeElapsed = 0`)
3. Calculated debt: 100 tokens (principal * 1e18/1e18)
4. Protocol receives no interest, attacker repeats to drain liquidity

For larger loans:
- Borrow 1M tokens, repay after 1 year
- Actual x = 0.0001 (after 31.5M seconds)
- Code computes x = 0 (3.17e9 *31.5e6 /1e18 = 0.1 → integer division to 0)
- Debt remains 1M tokens, protocol loses $10k/yr at 1% expected interest

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: Critical (CVSS 9.3)
- **Direct Impact**: Permanent loss of lender funds through interest-free loans
- **Business Impact**: Protocol insolvency as accrued interest becomes impossible
- **Attack Prerequisites**: Single transaction capability (flash loans)
- **Worst Case**: Complete drainage of lending pool via arbitrage attacks

### Remediation
Reconfigure scaling to preserve precision:
1. Remove initial division in `x` calculation
2. Adjust subsequent terms to use proper scaling
3. Use safe multiplication order

Modified function:
```solidity
function getCurrentDebt(address borrower) public view returns (uint256) {
    Loan memory loan = loans[borrower];
    if (loan.principal == 0) return 0;
    
    uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - loan.startTime;
    uint256 scale = 1e18;
    
    uint256 x = INTEREST_RATE_PER_SECOND * timeElapsed;
    uint256 x2 = x * x / scale;
    uint256 x3 = x2 * x / scale;
    
    uint256 expApprox = scale + x + (x2 / 2) + (x3 / 6);
    
    return (loan.principal * expApprox) / (scale ** 3);
}
```

## 🚨 Issue 2

### 📄 File: `Lending.sol`

### Original Code
```solidity
function repayLoan() external {
    Loan memory loan = loans[msg.sender];
    require(loan.principal > 0, "No active loan");
    uint256 debt = getCurrentDebt(msg.sender);
    uint256 collateral = loan.collateral;
    delete loans[msg.sender];

    require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), debt), "Token transfer failed");
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: collateral}("");
    require(success, "ETH refund failed");
}
```

### Synopsis
The interest calculation truncates fractional values due to integer division in `getCurrentDebt`, allowing borrowers to repay loans within ~315 seconds without paying interest. Attackers exploit this by taking flash loans and repaying quickly, draining protocol funds.

### Technical Details
The `x` value in `getCurrentDebt` uses integer division: `(INTEREST_RATE_PER_SECOND * timeElapsed) / 1e18`. For durations < 315 seconds, this results in `x=0` due to truncation. This eliminates interest accumulation (`expApprox=1e18`), allowing debt repayment at exactly the principal amount.

### Proof of Concept
1. Borrow 100 tokens at T=0
2. Repay loan after 300 seconds (5 minutes)
3. `x = (3,170,979,198 * 300) / 1e18 = 951,293,759,400 / 1e18 = 0` (integer division)
4. Debt = 100 * (1e18) / 1e18 = 100 tokens
5. Repay 100 tokens (0 interest) and recover full collateral

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: Protocol fails to collect interest on short-term loans
- **Attack Prerequisites**: Basic borrowing/repaying capability
- **Worst Case**: All loans become interest-free, protocol operates at loss, liquidity providers lose funds

### Remediation
Replace integer division with multiplication-first approach in interest calculation and track accumulated interest separately using a precision-preserving method:

```solidity
function repayLoan() external {
    Loan memory loan = loans[msg.sender];
    require(loan.principal > 0, "No active loan");
    
    uint256 interest = calculateAccruedInterest(loan);
    uint256 totalDebt = loan.principal + interest;
    
    delete loans[msg.sender];
    require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalDebt), "Repayment failed");
    (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: loan.collateral}("");
    require(success, "Collateral return failed");
}
```

## 🚨 Issue 3

### 📄 File: `Lending.sol`

### Original Code
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 borrowAmount) external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "Collateral required");
    require(loans[msg.sender].principal == 0, "Existing loan exists");
    
    uint256 price = oracle.getPrice();
    uint256 collateralValue = (msg.value * price) / 1e18;
    require(collateralValue * 100 >= borrowAmount * MIN_COLLATERAL_RATIO, "Insufficient collateral");
    
    loans[msg.sender] = Loan({
        collateral: msg.value,
        principal: borrowAmount,
        startTime: block.timestamp
    });
    
    require(token.transfer(msg.sender, borrowAmount), "Token transfer failed");
}
```

### Synopsis
The `borrow` function lacks validation for non-zero `borrowAmount`, allowing users to create loans with 0 principal. This traps their ETH collateral permanently as repayment becomes impossible. Attack vector: calling `borrow(0)` with ETH. Impact: irreversible loss of user funds.

### Technical Details
The vulnerability occurs due to missing validation of `borrowAmount > 0` in the `borrow` function. When users call `borrow(0)` with ETH:
1. `msg.value > 0` check passes
2. Zero principal loan is created
3. Collateral ETH is locked forever since:
   - `repayLoan()` requires `principal > 0` (which fails)
   - No other recovery mechanism exists
4. System treats this as valid loan but debt remains unrepayable

### Proof of Concept
1. Attacker calls `borrow(0)` with 1 ETH
2. Loan is created: `collateral = 1 ETH, principal = 0`
3. Attacker attempts to repay:
   - `repayLoan()` checks `loan.principal > 0` → reverts
4. 1 ETH remains permanently locked in contract

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** Critical (CVSS 9.0)
- **Direct Impact:** Permanent loss of user funds
- **Attack Cost:** Near-zero (simple transaction)
- **Prerequisites:** No special privileges needed
- **Worst Case:** Mass ETH lockup through accidental/malicious 0-amount borrows

### Remediation
Add explicit validation for positive borrow amounts:
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 borrowAmount) external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "Collateral required");
    require(borrowAmount > 0, "Cannot borrow 0 tokens"); // ← FIX
    require(loans[msg.sender].principal == 0, "Existing loan exists");
    // ... rest of function unchanged ...
}
```

## 🚨 Issue 4

### 📄 File: `Lending.sol`

### Original Code
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 borrowAmount) external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "Collateral required");
    require(loans[msg.sender].principal == 0, "Existing loan exists");
    
    uint256 price = oracle.getPrice();
    uint256 collateralValue = (msg.value * price) / 1e18;
    require(collateralValue * 100 >= borrowAmount * MIN_COLLATERAL_RATIO, "Insufficient collateral");
    
    loans[msg.sender] = Loan({
        collateral: msg.value,
        principal: borrowAmount,
        startTime: block.timestamp
    });
    
    require(token.transfer(msg.sender, borrowAmount), "Token transfer failed");
}
```

### Synopsis
The borrow function lacks validation of the oracle price input, allowing attackers to exploit manipulated prices (including zero) to create severely undercollateralized loans, risking protocol insolvency through artificially inflated collateral valuations.

### Technical Details
The vulnerability stems from missing sanity checks on the oracle's price value in the collateral calculation. The code uses `oracle.getPrice()` without verifying the returned value is greater than zero or within expected bounds. If the oracle returns zero (due to malfunction/attack) or an artificially inflated price, the collateral requirement check becomes mathematically trivial:

1. **Zero Price Scenario**: 
   - `collateralValue = (msg.value * 0) / 1e18 = 0`
   - Check becomes `0 * 100 >= borrowAmount * 150` → only passes if `borrowAmount=0` (already patched)

2. **Inflated Price Attack**:
   - With manipulated high prices, minimal ETH collateral satisfies the ratio check
   - e.g., $1 ETH collateral @ manipulated price of $1M allows borrowing $666,666 tokens

This enables undercollateralized borrowing when combined with oracle manipulation, bypassing the intended 150% collateralization requirement.

### Proof of Concept
1. Attacker deploys malicious oracle returning 1e36 (1e18 token/wei = 1e36 token/ETH)
2. Attacker calls `borrow(666666e18)` with 1 wei ETH (0.000000000000000001 ETH):
   - `collateralValue = (1 * 1e36) / 1e18 = 1e18 tokens`
   - Check: `1e18 * 100 = 1e20` ≥ `666666e18 * 150 = 999999e18` → passes
3. Attacker receives 666,666 tokens backed by near-zero collateral value

### Impact Assessment
**Critical Severity** (CVSS:9.3)  
Direct Impact:
- Complete protocol insolvency via mass undercollateralized loans
- Theft of lent tokens through worthless collateral  

Prerequisites:
- Compromised oracle (common attack vector in DeFi)
- No price validity checks in borrowing process

Worst-Case:
- Entire liquidity pool drained through artificially inflated collateral valuations
- Protocol becomes unable to cover debt obligations from remaining collateral

### Remediation
Add price validity checks in the borrow function and implement collateral maintenance checks during interest accrual:

1. **Validate Oracle Price**:
```solidity
require(price > 0, "Invalid oracle price");
require(price < type(uint160).max, "Price overflow risk");
```

2. **Update Interest Calculation** (in getCurrentDebt):
```solidity
function getCurrentDebt(address borrower) public view returns (uint256) {
    Loan memory loan = loans[borrower];
    if (loan.principal == 0) return 0;
    
    // Add collateral ratio check here
    uint256 currentCollateralValue = (loan.collateral * oracle.getPrice()) / 1e18;
    uint256 minRequired = (loan.principal * MIN_COLLATERAL_RATIO) / 100;
    require(currentCollateralValue >= minRequired, "Undercollateralized");
    
    // Existing interest calculation...
}
```

## 🚨 Issue 5

### 📄 File: `Lending.sol`

### Original Code
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 borrowAmount) external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "Collateral required");
    require(loans[msg.sender].principal == 0, "Existing loan exists");
    
    uint256 price = oracle.getPrice();
    uint256 collateralValue = (msg.value * price) / 1e18;
    require(collateralValue * 100 >= borrowAmount * MIN_COLLATERAL_RATIO, "Insufficient collateral");
    
    loans[msg.sender] = Loan({
        collateral: msg.value,
        principal: borrowAmount,
        startTime: block.timestamp
    });
    
    require(token.transfer(msg.sender, borrowAmount), "Token transfer failed");
}
```

### Synopsis
The `borrow` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to unsafe state management before an external call. An attacker can manipulate loan state during token transfer, enabling repeated borrowing and draining of contract funds.

### Technical Details
The vulnerability occurs because the contract:
1. Updates loan state *before* making an external `transfer` call
2. Fails to protect against reentrancy during the ERC20 transfer
3. Allows loan repayment during the borrow operation's external call

When using ERC777 tokens (or any token with callback functionality), an attacker can:
1. Initiate a borrow
2. Reenter via `tokensReceived` during transfer
3. Repay loan (deleting state)
4. Borrow again in same transaction

This bypasses the "Existing loan exists" check through state reset during reentrancy.

### Proof of Concept
1. Deploy malicious ERC777 token
2. Implement `tokensReceived` callback:
```solidity
function tokensReceived(address, /*...*/) external {
    if (currentStep == 0) {
        currentStep = 1;
        lendingContract.repayLoan();
        lendingContract.borrow(borrowAmount); 
    }
}
```
3. Call `borrow()` with sufficient collateral
4. During token transfer, callback executes:
   - Repays loan (deleting state)
   - Re-borrows using same collateral
5. Repeat until all liquidity drained

### Impact Assessment
Critical severity (CVSS 9.3):
- Direct loss of all lent tokens
- Permanent fund depletion
- Requires malicious token usage
- $100M+ risk for large pools

### Remediation
1. Add reentrancy guard to `borrow` and `repayLoan`
2. Follow checks-effects-interactions strictly

Modified `borrow` function:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract MinimalLending is ReentrancyGuard {
    function borrow(uint256 borrowAmount) external payable nonReentrant {
        // Existing logic remains unchanged
    }
}
```
