Below is an analysis of the provided code with focus on potential critical and major vulnerabilities:

---

### 1. External Dependency on Voting Power

**Observation:**  
The contract relies on an external contract (via the IVotingPower interface) to determine each voter’s power. If that external contract is poorly implemented or intentionally manipulated, it could allow a malicious actor to claim excessive voting power. Although this isn’t a vulnerability _in_ the Voting contract per se, the overall security is only as strong as the voting power contract.  

**Recommendation:**  
Ensure that the implementation of IVotingPower is thoroughly audited and trusted. You might consider adding additional checks (or even a trusted list of approved voting power contracts) if there’s any risk of a malicious implementation.

---

### 2. Proposal Execution via Low-Level Call

**Observation:**  
The `executeProposal()` function uses a low-level call (`proposalTarget.call(proposalData)`) to execute the proposal. While the function follows the checks-effects-interactions pattern by updating the `executed` flag before making the external call, this design still requires that the `proposalTarget` and `proposalData` are trusted and correct. If these inputs were ever compromised during deployment (or if the deployer supplies malicious values), an arbitrary function call could be executed.

**Risk Level:**  
*Major*—The risk is not due to reentrancy (since state is updated first and Solidity 0.8 provides reentrancy safety when used correctly) but because the contract delegates execution to an arbitrary target with arbitrary data. Misconfiguration or malicious deployment parameters could lead to unintended behavior.

**Recommendation:**  
- Validate the proposal details off-chain or through a multisig governance process before deployment.  
- Consider incorporating additional on-chain safeguards (such as restricting allowed targets or validating the proposal data format) if the design allows for broader use cases.

### 3. Lack of Voting Period or Expiry

**Observation:**  
There is no mechanism to limit the voting period. Votes can be cast indefinitely until the quorum is reached, which may or may not be intentional. In some governance scenarios, an unlimited voting period might allow manipulation or voting after conditions have changed.

**Risk Level:**  
*Minor to Major* (depending on the intended use case)—If the design expects a fixed voting period, then this omission can be problematic.

**Recommendation:**  
If the intent is to have a defined voting window, consider adding a start time and deadline to the voting process. This way, votes outside the intended window can be rejected.

### 4. Other Considerations

- **Double Voting Protection:**  
  The use of the `hasVoted` mapping effectively prevents double voting. This aspect of the code appears solid.

- **Atomicity and State Rollback:**  
  The design correctly updates state variables (e.g., setting `executed` to true) before making external calls. This ensures that even if the external call fails, the entire transaction reverts (due to Solidity’s transaction atomicity). There is no partial state update that could be exploited.

- **Fallbacks and Handling Unexpected Ether Transfers:**  
  The contract does not include any functions to recover accidentally sent Ether. While not a vulnerability in the voting logic, this might be worth noting if Ether could be sent to the contract by mistake.

### Conclusion

No critical vulnerabilities were found in the core logic of the Voting contract. However, the overall security heavily depends on:
- The trustworthiness and correct implementation of the external IVotingPower contract.
- The correctness and integrity of the proposal execution parameters (`proposalTarget` and `proposalData`).

Enhancing the safeguards around proposal execution and potentially introducing a voting period (if required by the governance model) would be advisable steps to mitigate risks.
