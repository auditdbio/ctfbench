As a senior smart contract auditor, I have analyzed the provided Vesting smart contract to identify CRITICAL and MAJOR vulnerabilities. Below is a detailed report outlining the findings, including descriptions, impacts, and recommendations for mitigation.
Vulnerability Report
CRITICAL Vulnerabilities
1. Lack of Access Control in release Function
Description: The release function lacks any access control mechanism, allowing any address to call it. This means that not only the intended beneficiary but also any external user or contract can trigger the release of vested tokens, as long as the cliff condition is met and there are unreleased tokens available.
Impact: While the tokens are still transferred to the beneficiary, this vulnerability undermines the autonomy of the beneficiary over the release schedule. Unauthorized calls could lead to tokens being released at unintended times, potentially disrupting financial planning, tax strategies, or token distribution schedules. In extreme cases, malicious actors could repeatedly call release to front-run the beneficiary or interfere with their intended actions.
Recommendation: Restrict the release function to be callable only by the beneficiary. This can be achieved by adding an access control check. Here’s a suggested fix:
solidity
modifier onlyBeneficiary() {
    require(msg.sender == beneficiary, "Only beneficiary can release");
    _;
}

function release() public onlyBeneficiary {
    require(block.timestamp >= cliff);
    uint256 unreleased = releasableAmount();
    require(unreleased > 0);
    released += unreleased;
    token.safeTransfer(beneficiary, unreleased);
}
Alternatively, a simpler inline check can be used:
solidity
require(msg.sender == beneficiary, "Only beneficiary can release");
MAJOR Vulnerabilities
1. Inflation of Vesting Amount Due to Dynamic Total Balance
Description: The vestedAmount function calculates the total vesting amount (totalBalance) as the current balance of the contract (token.balanceOf(address(this))) plus the released amount. Since the contract does not fix the vesting amount at deployment, anyone can send additional tokens to the contract after initialization, inflating totalBalance. This increases the amount of tokens that can be vested and subsequently released, beyond what was originally intended.
Impact: If the contract is deployed with an intended vesting amount (e.g., 1000 tokens), and an attacker sends an additional 1000 tokens to the contract, the totalBalance doubles to 2000 tokens. The vesting schedule would then allow the beneficiary to claim up to 2000 tokens, effectively doubling the intended payout. This could lead to significant financial loss for the token issuer or disrupt the token economics, especially if the contract is part of a larger token distribution plan.
Recommendation: Fix the total vesting amount at the time of deployment by recording the initial token balance in the constructor and using this value instead of dynamically calculating totalBalance. Here’s a suggested fix:
solidity
uint256 public totalVestingAmount;

constructor(IERC20 _token, address _beneficiary, uint256 _start, uint256 _cliff, uint256 _duration) {
    require(_beneficiary != address(0));
    token = _token;
    beneficiary = _beneficiary;
    start = _start;
    cliff = _start + _cliff;
    duration = _duration;
    totalVestingAmount = _token.balanceOf(address(this)); // Set at deployment
}

function vestedAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
    if (block.timestamp < cliff) {
        return 0;
    } else if (block.timestamp >= start + duration) {
        return totalVestingAmount;
    } else {
        return totalVestingAmount * (block.timestamp - start) / duration;
    }
}
This ensures that only the tokens present at deployment are considered for vesting, preventing inflation from additional token transfers. Any excess tokens sent later would remain in the contract but would not affect the vesting schedule. Optionally, a function could be added to allow withdrawal of excess tokens by an authorized party (e.g., the beneficiary or an admin), though this is not strictly necessary for the core vesting functionality.
Additional Notes
Reentrancy: The release function uses SafeERC20.safeTransfer for token transfers, and the state variable released is updated before the external call. This prevents reentrancy attacks, as any reentrant call would find releasableAmount() returning 0 due to the updated released value. No vulnerability here.
Vesting Logic: The vesting schedule, with a cliff period followed by linear vesting from start to start + duration, is correctly implemented. The calculation in vestedAmount respects the cliff (returning 0 before cliff) and caps at the total amount after duration.
Solidity Version: The contract uses Solidity 0.8.0, which includes built-in overflow checks, mitigating integer overflow/underflow risks in arithmetic operations.
Timestamp Manipulation: Reliance on block.timestamp is present, but given the long-term nature of vesting schedules (typically months or years), minor manipulations by miners (a few seconds) are negligible and not a significant concern.
Events: The contract does not emit events (e.g., for token releases), which is not a vulnerability but a missed opportunity for transparency and tracking. Adding an event like event TokensReleased(address beneficiary, uint256 amount) in the release function could enhance usability.
Conclusion
The Vesting contract contains one CRITICAL vulnerability (lack of access control in release) and one MAJOR vulnerability (inflation of vesting amount due to dynamic balance). Both issues can be addressed with straightforward modifications:
Add an onlyBeneficiary restriction to the release function.
Fix the totalVestingAmount at deployment and use it in vestedAmount.
With these fixes, the contract would be significantly more secure and align better with the intended functionality of a vesting mechanism, ensuring that only the beneficiary can trigger releases and that the vested amount remains consistent with the initial allocation.
