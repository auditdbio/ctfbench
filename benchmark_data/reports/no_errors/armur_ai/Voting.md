# **Voting Contract Documentation**

# **Overview**

This documentation provides a comprehensive explanation of the Voting smart contract implemented in Solidity. The purpose of this contract is to facilitate decentralized voting mechanisms by interacting with an auxiliary voting power provider contract to determine the voting power of different addresses.

# **Contract Structure**

#### **Interfaces**

- **IVotingPower**: The interface IVotingPower provides the structure for a fundamental function within another contractâ€”votingPower, intended to return the voting power of a particular address. This interface is key for interacting with any contract that can provide voting power metrics.
### **State Variables**

- **votingPowerContract**: An immutable instance of IVotingPower interfaced contract, which is set during the deployment of Voting. It is used to access the voting power of voters.
- **hasVoted**: A mapping storing boolean values indicating whether an address has voted.
- **totalVotes**: A public unsigned integer tracking the cumulative voting weight cast.
- **quorumVotes**: An immutable unsigned integer representing the number of votes required to execute a proposal.
- **proposalTarget**: An immutable address to which the proposal execution call is made.
- **proposalData**: A bytes array containing the data for proposal execution.
- **executed**: A boolean indicator showing if the proposal has been executed.

#### **Events**

- **VoteCast**: Emitted each time a vote is successfully cast.
- **ProposalExecuted**: Emitted upon the successful execution of a proposal.

### **Constructor**

```
constructor(
  address _votingPowerContract,
  uint256 _quorumVotes,
  address _proposalTarget,
  bytes memory _proposalData
)
```
- Initializes the Voting contract with an immutable link to the voting power contract, proposal details, and the quorum.
- Ensures non-zero addresses for _votingPowerContract and _proposalTarget for execution to proceed properly.

# **Functions**

### **vote()**

function vote() external

- **Description**: This function allows an account to cast its vote. It first checks that the caller hasn't voted yet and possesses non-zero voting power.
- **Mechanism**:
	- 1. Checks if the caller has already voted by consulting the hasVoted registry.
	- 2. Retrieves voting power via votingPowerContract.votingPower(msg.sender).
	- 3. Updates the hasVoted status and total voting weight (totalVotes).
	- 4. Emits VoteCast event post successful voting.

### **executeProposal()**

function executeProposal() external

- **Description**: Executes the proposal once the quorum is met; it ensures a proposal cannot be executed more than once.
- **Mechanism**:
	- 1. Checks that executed is false and totalVotes are equal to or surpass quorumVotes.
	- 2. Calls proposalTarget with proposalData.
	- 3. Requires successful proposal execution.
	- 4. Updates execution status and emits ProposalExecuted.

# **Best Practices**

- **Security**: Always verify external calls and handle returned data cautiously to prevent reentrancy or undesired conditions.
- **Gas Optimization**: Mark variables as immutable when suitable and constrain functions with external modifier to optimize resource utilization.
- **Check-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Logical state modifications precede external interactions to protect against malicious reentrancy.

# **Conclusion**

This contract facilitates decentralized interaction by enabling weighted voting systems interfaced through tokenized voting power. Leveraging security best practices and optimized state transparency, it offers a reliable medium for proposal execution in decentralized applications.

Certainly! Below is a code security audit for the provided Solidity contract. This audit will identify potential security vulnerabilities and suggest necessary fixes to mitigate such issues.

# **Security Audit Report for Voting Contract**

#### **Contract Summary**

The Voting contract allows users to cast votes weighted by their voting power retrieved from the IVotingPower contract. The contract enforces a quorum requirement for the proposal execution.

### **Identified Security Issues**

#### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**:

- **Description**: The executeProposal function allows external method calls with untrusted contracts, creating opportunities for a reentrancy vulnerability if any called contracts are not well-designed.
- **Potential Risks**: An external contract with recursive call capabilities could exploit the execution process, executing the proposal multiple times.
- **Recommendation**: Use a reentrancy guard pattern to mitigate the risk. Consider using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard or implementing a custom guard.

#### 2. **Missing Access Control**:

- **Description**: There is no access control mechanism on the executeProposal function, allowing any user to trigger it.
- **Potential Risks**: Unauthorized users might trigger proposal execution if the quorum condition is met, regardless of any governance intentions.
- **Recommendation**: Implement an access control mechanism or governance logic to restrict who can execute proposals. Use Ownable, or introduce a governance rule to allow only specific roles to execute the proposal.

#### 3. **Lack of Upgradeability Considering Immutable Variables** :

#### 3. **Lack of Upgradeability Considering Immutable Variables** :

- **Description**: The contract uses immutable variables but doesn't account for upgrades.
- **Potential Risks**: If the governance logic or the referenced contract (IVotingPower) needs updates, deploying a new contract and losing state must occur unless an upgradeable pattern is in place.
- **Recommendation**: Consider using an upgradeability pattern (e.g., OpenZeppelin Upgradeable Contracts) if future upgrades or changes in the VotingPower interface are anticipated. Alternatively, upgrade through the governance process with a clear migration path.

#### 4. **Event Emission for Successful Execution**:

- **Description**: The ProposalExecuted event is emitted only when a proposal executes successfully. This incompleteness may cause reliance on logs for tracking, lacking insight into all execution attempts.
- **Potential Risks**: Audit logging and tracing security events become incomplete, particularly if there are multiple actions invoked.
- **Recommendation**: Emit an event when an execution attempt occurs, and log any failure with relevant information.

#### 5. **No Deadline for Voting**:

- **Description**: There is no deadline for when voting is concluded. If the scope allows indefinite voting, proposals may never be executed.
- **Potential Risks**: Prevents closure on governance matters, inhibiting operational clarity.
- **Recommendation**: Introduce a deadline after which no votes are accepted. This deadline will bring execution certainty, ensuring timeliness for governance decisions.

#### 6. **Unchecked Call Return Data**:

- **Description**: The contract does not check the return data of the proposal execution call in detail other than ensuring the call success.
- **Potential Risks**: Introduces ambiguity into the proposal execution outcome, potentially masking failures unless directly inspected.
- **Recommendation**: Include logic to handle specific expected outcomes or states from the call's return data; if possible, include checks on the expected format or structure of the return data.

### **Suggested Improvements**

- **Documentation and Code Comments**: Enhance code comments for clarity, especially about the expected behaviors of execution, vote criteria, and key contract logic sections. This facilitates better understanding and maintenance.
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage to check edge cases such as:
	- Handling when quorumVotes exceeds total possible voting power.
	- Security around potential DOS vectors such as gas limits due to large proposal data.
	- Governance tests to explore consensus failure scenarios or prolonged execution pathways.

### **Conclusion**

The Voting contract implements fundamental governance mechanisms using Solidity smart contracts but exhibits potential vulnerabilities common in decentralized systems. By addressing the flagged issues, primarily around reentrancy, access control, proposal execution timing, and comprehensive event logging, the contract can be significantly hardened against malicious intentions.

Implementing these recommendations will strengthen the code against misuse while optimizing decision transparency and operational security. Further inspections, particularly by a security-accredited auditor, are always advised as an additional check beyond provided code reviews.

### **Test cases**

The Solidity code you provided is a smart contract that facilitates a voting mechanism where users can vote on a proposal and, if enough votes are gathered (meeting quorum), execute a specified proposal. Let's write a set of test cases in Solidity using the Hardhat framework to test this smart contract. The tests will verify that the important functionalities, such as voting and executing proposals, work correctly.

### **Testing the Voting Contract**

To test the Voting contract, we have to create a mock implementation of the IVotingPower interface within our test suite since the contract relies on it. The mock will help simulate various scenarios of voting power for different addresses.

import "../contracts/Voting.sol";
contract VotingTest {
  IVotingPower votingPowerContract;
  Voting votingContract;
  address owner;
  address voter1;
  address voter2;
  address proposalAddress;
  function beforeEach() public {
    owner = address(this);
    voter1 = address(uint160(uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("voter1")))));
    voter2 = address(uint160(uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("voter2")))));
    proposalAddress = address(uint160(uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("proposal")))));
    votingPowerContract = new MockIVotingPower();
    votingContract = new Voting(
       address(votingPowerContract),
       100, // quorumVotes
       proposalAddress,
       abi.encodeWithSignature("executeProposal()")
    );
  }
  function testVote() public {
     uint256 initialVotes = votingContract.totalVotes();
     // Assign voting power to voter1
    MockIVotingPower(address(votingPowerContract)).setVotingPower(voter1, 50);
     // Simulate voter1 voting
    vm.prank(voter1);
    votingContract.vote();
     // Check if the vote was successful
    assertEq(votingContract.totalVotes(), initialVotes + 50);
    assertTrue(votingContract.hasVoted(voter1));
  }
  function testVoteWithoutPower() public {
     // Simulate voter2 without voting power attempting to vote
    vm.prank(voter2);
    vm.expectRevert("No voting power");
    votingContract.vote();
  }
  function testExecuteProposal() public {
     // Assign voting power to voter1 and voter2
    MockIVotingPower(address(votingPowerContract)).setVotingPower(voter1, 60);
    MockIVotingPower(address(votingPowerContract)).setVotingPower(voter2, 50);
     // Simulate voter1 and voter2 voting
    vm.prank(voter1);
    votingContract.vote();
    vm.prank(voter2);
    votingContract.vote();
    assertTrue(votingContract.totalVotes() >= votingContract.quorumVotes());
     // Execute proposal
    vm.prank(owner);
    votingContract.executeProposal();
```
assertTrue(votingContract.executed());

```
}
  function testExecuteWithoutQuorum() public {
    // Assign voting power to voter1
    MockIVotingPower(address(votingPowerContract)).setVotingPower(voter1, 50);
    // Simulate voter1 voting
    vm.prank(voter1);
    votingContract.vote();
    // Attempt to execute proposal without reaching quorum
    vm.prank(owner);
    vm.expectRevert("Quorum not reached");
    votingContract.executeProposal();
  }
}
// Mock contract for IVotingPower
contract MockIVotingPower is IVotingPower {
  mapping(address => uint256) public powers;
  function setVotingPower(address account, uint256 power) external {
    powers[account] = power;
  }
  function votingPower(address account) external view override returns (uint256) {
    return powers[account];
  }
}
```
### **Explanation:**

- 1. **Mock Contract**: We've created a MockIVotingPower contract to simulate the voting power of accounts.
- 2. **beforeEach Function**: Setups the environment for each test case, initializing the Voting contract, mock contract, and accounts.
- 3. **testVote Function**: Checks the voting function by assigning voting power to a voter and ensuring that the total votes are updated correctly.
- 4. **testVoteWithoutPower Function**: Attempts to vote without any voting power and expects the operation to revert.
- 5. **testExecuteProposal Function**: Simulates a scenario where the quorum is reached, and a proposal is executed successfully.
- 6. **testExecuteWithoutQuorum Function**: Tests the failure case where a proposal execution is attempted without meeting the quorum.

You may run these tests using a JavaScript/TypeScript test setup with Hardhat to compile, deploy, and test the contracts automatically. Ensure your Hardhat configuration and environment are set up properly to use libraries like chai for assertions and sinon for mocking behaviors if necessary in more complex tests.

These tests simulate the key functionalities of the Voting contract, ensuring it behaves as expected under common scenarios and edge cases.

# **Optimizations**

Here are some optimizations that can be applied to the given code:

- 1. **State Mutability Specifications**: Use pure or view where possible to save gas by specifying functions that do not modify state. The votingPower function is a view function but has already been handled by IVotingPower. Ensure that all state-modifying functions are marked view or pure as appropriate.
- 2. **Event Emit Optimization**: Emit an event prior to making state changes for better failure tracing. However, in this contract, the events are placed correctly after successful state changes.
- 3. **Use unchecked for Safe Arithmetic (Post Solidity 0.8)** : Solidity 0.8 introduced automatic overflow/underflow checking, which incurs overhead. If you can guarantee no overflow (perhaps due to previous validation or inherent constraints), using unchecked { ... } can save some gas.
- 4. **Consistent use of State Mutability**: While your constructor has immutable variables which make it gas efficient, ensure to continue consistent practices if you add more functions.
- 5. **Restrict External Visibility When Not Needed**: The executeProposal and vote functions are marked as external. If these operations are not supposed to be called outside thecontract, convert them to public if they are accessed internally. This isn't applicable here immediately but is a consideration when expanding contract capabilities.
- 6. **Error Messages**: Provide more detailed revert messages to make contract use easier and debugging information richer.

Below is the revised code taking these suggestions into account:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
interface IVotingPower {
  function votingPower(address account) external view returns (uint256);
}
contract Voting {
  IVotingPower public immutable votingPowerContract;
  mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
  uint256 public totalVotes;
  uint256 public immutable quorumVotes;
  address public immutable proposalTarget;
  bytes public proposalData;
  bool public executed;
  event VoteCast(address indexed voter, uint256 weight);
  event ProposalExecuted(address indexed executor, bool success, bytes returnData);
  constructor(
    address _votingPowerContract,
    uint256 _quorumVotes,
    address _proposalTarget,
    bytes memory _proposalData
  ) {
    require(_votingPowerContract != address(0), "Voting: Invalid voting power contract
address");
    require(_proposalTarget != address(0), "Voting: Invalid proposal target address");
    votingPowerContract = IVotingPower(_votingPowerContract);
    quorumVotes = _quorumVotes;
    proposalTarget = _proposalTarget;
    proposalData = _proposalData;
  }
  function vote() external {
    require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Voting: You have already voted");
    uint256 power = votingPowerContract.votingPower(msg.sender);
    require(power > 0, "Voting: No voting power");
    hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    unchecked {
       totalVotes += power;
    }
    emit VoteCast(msg.sender, power);
  }
  function executeProposal() external {
    require(!executed, "Voting: Proposal already executed");
    require(totalVotes >= quorumVotes, "Voting: Quorum not reached");
```

```
executed = true;
    (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = proposalTarget.call(proposalData);
    require(success, "Voting: Proposal execution failed");
    emit ProposalExecuted(msg.sender, success, returnData);
  }
}
```
### **Description of Optimizations:**

- 1. **Unchecked Arithmetic**: Using unchecked around the totalVotes += power; saves gas by preventing unnecessary overflow checks, which your logic ensures won't occur as voting power is assumed to be logically determined and bounded.
- 2. **Revert Messages**: Improved messages with namespace Voting to clarify the source of an error. This yields better debugging information.
- 3. **Event Emit Placement**: Already optimal because events are emitted after state changes to log only successfully processed states.
- 4. **State Mutability Consistency**: All functions that don't modify the state and are accessing constants are already optimized to be view. Maintain this diligent practice.

Each of these updates streamlines the contract for efficiency and maintainability, ensuring that resources are not wasted on unnecessary operations or verbosity.
