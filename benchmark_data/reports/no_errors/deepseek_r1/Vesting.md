The Vesting contract contains several critical vulnerabilities that need to be addressed:

### Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Incorrect Vesting Schedule Calculation**
   - **Issue**: The `vestedAmount` function calculates the vested tokens based on the time elapsed since `start` instead of the `cliff`. This results in an incorrect vesting schedule, especially when the `cliff` is meant to delay the start of vesting. The vesting period should start at `cliff` and last for `duration`, but the current code uses `start + duration` as the end time.
   - **Impact**: This leads to incorrect token distribution, potentially allowing the beneficiary to receive tokens earlier than intended or causing vesting to end prematurely.
   - **Fix**: Adjust the calculation to use `(block.timestamp - cliff)` for vested time and set the vesting end time to `cliff + duration`.

2. **Reliance on Dynamic Token Balance**
   - **Issue**: The `vestedAmount` function uses the contract's current token balance plus released tokens (`token.balanceOf(address(this)) + released`), making the vesting amount vulnerable to manipulation by transferring tokens in/out of the contract.
   - **Impact**: An attacker can manipulate the vesting schedule by depositing or withdrawing tokens, leading to incorrect vested amounts.
   - **Fix**: Store the initial token balance in the constructor and use this fixed amount for all vesting calculations.

### Major Vulnerability

- **Incorrect Cliff-Duration Validation**
  - **Issue**: The constructor does not enforce that `_cliff` (as a duration) is less than or equal to `_duration`. If `_cliff` exceeds `_duration`, the entire vested amount is released immediately after the cliff.
  - **Impact**: This could result in immediate full vesting after the cliff, bypassing the intended gradual release.
  - **Fix**: Add a constructor check: `require(_cliff <= _duration, "Cliff exceeds duration")`.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. **Cliff and Duration Mismanagement**:
   - If `_cliff` is set to 1 year and `_duration` to 1 year, vesting ends at `start + 1 year`. If the cliff is at `start + 1 year`, the vested amount becomes 100% immediately after the cliff, which is likely unintended.

2. **Token Balance Manipulation**:
   - An attacker sends extra tokens to the contract, increasing the `totalBalance` used in `vestedAmount()`. This allows the beneficiary to claim more tokens than originally intended.

### Recommendations

1. **Refactor Vesting Logic**:
   ```solidity
   uint256 public totalVestingAmount; // Added to store initial balance

   constructor(...) {
       ...
       totalVestingAmount = token.balanceOf(address(this)); // Capture initial balance
   }

   function vestedAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
       if (block.timestamp < cliff) return 0;
       uint256 elapsed = block.timestamp - cliff;
       if (elapsed > duration) return totalVestingAmount;
       return totalVestingAmount * elapsed / duration;
   }
   ```

2. **Add Input Validations**:
   ```solidity
   require(_cliff <= _duration, "Cliff exceeds duration");
   ```

3. **Use Fixed Vesting Amount**:
   - Replace dynamic balance checks with a fixed `totalVestingAmount` initialized in the constructor to prevent manipulation.

By addressing these issues, the contract will correctly implement a secure vesting schedule resistant to external manipulations.
