The provided Voting contract contains several critical and major vulnerabilities:

1. **Critical Vulnerability: Double Voting via Voting Power Transfer (Lack of Snapshot)**
   - **Description**: The contract retrieves the current voting power from `IVotingPower` at the time of voting. If the underlying voting power (e.g., token balances) can be transferred between accounts, users can vote, transfer their voting power to another address, and vote again. This allows an attacker to multiply their voting power, breaking the governance mechanism.
   - **Example**: Alice votes with 100 tokens, transfers them to Bob, who then votes again with the same 100 tokens.
   - **Fix**: Implement a snapshot mechanism to lock voting power at a specific block (e.g., during contract deployment) or ensure `IVotingPower` uses an immutable snapshot.

2. **Major Vulnerability: Unrestricted Execution of Proposal**
   - **Description**: The `executeProposal` function can be called by any address once the quorum is met. This allows malicious actors to front-run or exploit timing advantages, especially if the proposal execution includes privileged operations or rewards.
   - **Fix**: Restrict execution to specific roles (e.g., voters, governance multisig) or include a timelock to mitigate front-running.

3. **Major Vulnerability: Lack of Voting Deadline**
   - **Description**: The contract does not enforce a voting period, allowing proposals to remain open indefinitely. This could delay critical decisions or enable unexpected execution long after the voting context is relevant.
   - **Fix**: Add a time-bound mechanism (e.g., `startTime` and `endTime`) to limit the voting window.

**Recommendations**:
- Use a snapshot of voting power at the time of proposal creation to prevent double voting.
- Restrict `executeProposal` to authorized addresses or implement a commit-reveal scheme.
- Introduce a voting deadline to ensure proposals expire if quorum isnâ€™t met within a reasonable timeframe.
