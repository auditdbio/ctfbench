### 2. Lack of Re-Entrancy Protection in Voting Contract

#### **Input Code**
```solidity
function executeProposal() external {
    require(!executed, "Proposal already executed");
    require(totalVotes >= quorumVotes, "Quorum not reached");

    executed = true;
    (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = proposalTarget.call(proposalData);
    require(success, "Proposal execution failed");

    emit ProposalExecuted(msg.sender, success, returnData);
}
```

- **Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ *Quality Assurance*  
- **Impact:**  
  The `Voting` contract does not implement any re-entrancy guards. While there are several checks at the beginning of functions to prevent re-entrancy (e.g., `require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted");` and `require(!executed, "Proposal already executed");`), these checks can be bypassed by calling methods in other contracts during the execution of `vote()` or `executeProposal()`. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the voting process or double-expend their voting power.

#### **Description**
Proof of Concept

Re-entrancy is a common vulnerability in smart contracts where an external call allows the caller to execute code before the initial function call has completed. This can be used to exploit contracts that hold and manage assets, allowing for unauthorized access or modification of the contract state.

The `Voting` contract makes an external call to `proposalTarget` in the `executeProposal()` function. Since there is no re-entrancy guard, if `proposalTarget` is another contract, it can potentially call back into the `Voting` contract, bypassing the checks and manipulating the state variables `hasVoted` or `executed`.

This vulnerability can be exploited to allow an attacker to vote multiple times or execute a proposal without reaching the quorum, effectively breaking the voting process.

#### **Recommendations**
Consider using the OpenZeppelin Contracts library's `ReentrancyGuard` contract. Inherit from `ReentrancyGuard` and use the `nonReentrant` modifier on vulnerable functions like `executeProposal()`.

Alternatively, if the functions are not intended to be called by external parties or do not require interaction with other contracts, ensure that all external calls are properly validated and consider rearranging the logic to avoid such vulnerabilities.
