## Issues

### 1. Inaccurate Debt Calculation May Result in Incorrect Loan Repayment Amounts

#### **Input Code**
```solidity
function getCurrentDebt(address borrower) public view returns (uint256) {
    Loan memory loan = loans[borrower];
    if (loan.principal == 0) return 0;
    uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - loan.startTime;
    uint256 scale = 1e18;

    uint256 x = (INTEREST_RATE_PER_SECOND * timeElapsed) / scale;
    
    uint256 x2 = (x * x) / scale;
    uint256 x3 = (x2 * x) / scale;
    
    uint256 expApprox = scale + x + (x2 / 2) + (x3 / 6);
    
    return (loan.principal * expApprox) / scale;
}
```

- **Severity:** ðŸŸ  *Medium*  
- **Impact:**  
  The `getCurrentDebt` function, which is used to calculate the repayment amount for a borrower, may return an inaccurate debt value due to the approximation formula `expApprox` used to estimate the exponential function. This could lead to users either overpaying or underpaying their loans.

#### **Description**
The function `getCurrentDebt(address borrower)` estimates the debt amount using an approximation formula for the exponential function `expApprox = scale + x + (x2 / 2) + (x3 / 6)`, where `x` is `(INTEREST_RATE_PER_SECOND * timeElapsed) / scale`. However, this approximation may introduce significant error, especially for large `timeElapsed` values, leading to incorrect debt calculation.

#### **Recommendations**
âœ… Use a more accurate method to calculate the exponential function, such as a series expansion with more terms or a library function for exponentiation. Alternatively, add a fixed-point math library for better precision in all arithmetic operations.

### 2. User Can Avoid Debt by Under-Collateralizing Loan Using Incorrect Oracle Value

#### **Input Code**
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 borrowAmount) external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "Collateral required");
    require(loans[msg.sender].principal == 0, "Existing loan exists");
    
    uint256 price = oracle.getPrice();
    uint256 collateralValue = (msg.value * price) / 1e18;
    require(collateralValue * 100 >= borrowAmount * MIN_COLLATERAL_RATIO, "Insufficient collateral");
    
    loans[msg.sender] = Loan({
        collateral: msg.value,
        principal: borrowAmount,
        startTime: block.timestamp
    });
    
    require(token.transfer(msg.sender, borrowAmount), "Token transfer failed");
}
```

- **Severity:** ðŸŸ  *Medium*  
- **Impact:**  
  A user can manipulate the price returned by the oracle, allowing them to borrow funds without sufficient collateral, by creating a loan with an incorrect oracle value. This could result in losses for the protocol. Note, this attack requires cooperation with the oracle provider, so may not be a realistic scenario.

#### **Description**
In the function `borrow(uint256 borrowAmount)`, the collateral amount is calculated using a price obtained from an oracle (`uint256 price = oracle.getPrice();`). However, if the oracle returns an incorrect price, the collateral may be insufficient to cover the debt, allowing the user to exploit the system.

#### **Recommendations**
âœ… Ensure that the oracle provider is trustworthy and that the price it provides is accurate. Implement checks to verify the correctness of the oracle's data before using it in calculations.
