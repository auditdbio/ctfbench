# Vesting Smart Contract Security Analysis

## Issue
**File:** Vesting.sol


## Output

**Severity:** Low  

### Block timestamp

### Description
The smart contract uses block.timestamp for time-based logic, which can be manipulated within a certain range by miners. This vulnerability is low-severity because it is not directly exploitable for financial gain in this context (the beneficiary's vested amount is simply time-locked and can be claimed over time), but it could be a potential source of uncertainty or inconsistency in the contract's behavior. Miners can influence the timestamp to a small extent, generally up to 15 seconds, which could affect the 'cliff' or 'duration' periods, potentially causing a release to occur earlier than intended.


```solidity
} else if (block.timestamp >= start + duration) {
```

### Block timestamp

### Description
The smart contract uses the 'block.timestamp' for comparisons, which can potentially be manipulated by miners to a certain extent. This could lead to a situation where a miner includes a transaction in a block that has a timestamp slightly in the future, which in turn could affect the outcome of the 'require' statements, such as 'require(block.timestamp >= cliff)' or 'require(unreleased > 0)'. While the impact of this on the actual release of funds or vesting schedule is minor, it still represents a low-level vulnerability as it could potentially be exploited in edge cases.


```solidity
require(unreleased > 0);
```
