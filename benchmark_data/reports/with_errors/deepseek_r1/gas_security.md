The Airdrop contract has several critical and major vulnerabilities that need to be addressed:

### Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Failed Transfers Block Distribution**  
   The `distribute()` function uses a loop to send tokens to all participants. If **any transfer fails** (e.g., a participant is a contract that reverts on token receipt), the entire transaction reverts, leaving the distribution incomplete. Since `distributed` is set to `true` **before** the loop, repeated failures could permanently prevent distribution.  
   **Impact**: Tokens become stuck in the contract.  
   **Fix**: Use a pull pattern (allow participants to withdraw tokens individually) or handle failed transfers gracefully (e.g., skip failed addresses and track remaining balances).

2. **Gas Limit Exhaustion**  
   Looping through all participants in `distribute()` may exceed block gas limits if the participant list is large, rendering the function unusable.  
   **Impact**: Distribution becomes impossible.  
   **Fix**: Implement batch processing or use a pull mechanism to avoid gas-intensive loops.

### Major Vulnerabilities

1. **Dust Tokens Remain Locked**  
   If the contract’s token balance isn’t perfectly divisible by the number of participants, division truncation leaves residual tokens locked forever.  
   **Impact**: Loss of unallocated tokens.  
   **Fix**: Track residual tokens and allow recovery by an admin or distribute them proportionally.

2. **Constructor Registration Failure**  
   The constructor calls `register()`, which reverts if the deployer isn’t eligible (e.g., `eligible.isEligible(deployer)` is `false`), preventing contract deployment.  
   **Impact**: Deployment failure under invalid eligibility conditions.  
   **Fix**: Remove `register()` from the constructor or ensure deployer eligibility.

### Recommendations

- **Avoid Push Distributions**: Replace the loop with a pull-based system where participants claim tokens individually.
- **Handle Residual Tokens**: Add a function to recover unallocated tokens post-distribution.
- **Batch Processing**: Allow distributing tokens in batches to avoid gas limits.
- **Remove Constructor Registration**: Avoid automatic registration during deployment to prevent revert risks.

These issues must be resolved to ensure reliable token distribution and prevent fund loss.
