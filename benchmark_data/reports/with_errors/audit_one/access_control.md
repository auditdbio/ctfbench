## Issues

### 1. Either Function or Contract can be Specified to be Non-Executable

#### **Input Code**
```solidity
function winningProposal() public view returns (uint256 winningProposalIndex) {
```

- **Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ *Quality Assurance*  
- **Impact:**  
  When code is executable but should not be executable (controllable for mis-function), it can cause unexpected results or raise faults (in or to connect with other executable code parts/artifacts) as per specified (and/or intended) connectivity/syntax/behavior.

#### **Illustration**
```solidity
function winningProposal() public view returns (uint256 winningProposalIndex) {
    uint256 winningVoteCount = 0;
    for (uint i = 0; i < proposals.length; i++) {
        if (proposals[i].voteCount > winningVoteCount) {
            winningVoteCount = proposals[i].voteCount;
            winningProposalIndex = i;
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Recommendations**
âœ… Consider removing (or correcting) the code part(s) to be non-executable (controllable for mis-function) as specified (and/or intended).

### 2. Owner Transfer Does Not Follow a Secure Pattern

#### **Input Code**
```solidity
function setOwner(address newOwner) public {
    owner = newOwner;
}
```

- **Severity:** ðŸŸ¢ *Low*  
- **Impact:**  
  The voting pool becomes inaccessible if the owner transfers authority to an invalid address.

#### **Description**
The owner transfers authority to a new address using `setOwner()`. If the new address is invalid, the contract becomes inaccessible.

#### **Recommendations**
âœ… Use `Ownable2Step` from OpenZeppelin to implement a two-step process for owner change. Ensure that the new owner address is valid.

---

### 3. Proposal Can Be Added After `votingDeadline` Has Passed

#### **Input Code**
```solidity
function addProposal(string memory description) public onlyOwner {
```

- **Severity:** ðŸŸ  *Medium*  
- **Impact:**  
  Voting can be disrupted by adding new proposals after the voting deadline.

#### **Description**
Before calling `vote()`, `CTFVoting.proposalCount` should be checked to ensure that the `proposalIndex` is valid. However, if the owner adds a new proposal after `votingDeadline` has passed in `CTFVoting.addProposal()`, this could increase the number of proposals and make some existing `proposalIndex` values invalid.

#### **Illustration**
```solidity
function vote(uint256 proposalIndex) public {
    require(block.timestamp < votingDeadline, "Voting ended");
    require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
    require(proposalIndex < proposals.length, "Invalid proposal");

    proposals[proposalIndex].voteCount++;
    hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
}

function addProposal(string memory description) public onlyOwner {
    require(block.timestamp < votingDeadline, "Voting ended");
    proposals.push(Proposal({description: description, voteCount: 0}));
}
```

#### **Recommendations**
âœ… Remove the `votingDeadline` check in `CTFVoting.addProposal()`.
