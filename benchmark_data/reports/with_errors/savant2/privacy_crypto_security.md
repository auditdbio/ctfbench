## 🚨 Issue 1

### 📄 File: `MerkleDrop.sol`

### Issue Code Highlight

```solidity
    function verifyProof(
        bytes32[] calldata proof,
        bytes32 root,
        bytes32 leaf
    ) internal pure returns (bool) {
        bytes32 computedHash = leaf;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proof.length; i++) {
            bytes32 proofElement = proof[i];
            if (computedHash <= proofElement) {
                computedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(computedHash, proofElement));
            } else {
                computedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(proofElement, computedHash));
            }
        }
        return computedHash == root;
    }
```

### Synopsis

Merkle proof verification fails to enforce minimum proof length requirements, enabling invalid root validation when processing malformed proof arrays with unexpected lengths that truncate the hash computation prematurely.

### Technical Details

The verification algorithm doesn't validate proof length against expected tree depth, allowing crafted short proofs that terminate computation early. When combined with hash ordering vulnerabilities, this allows attackers to construct shorter proof paths that:
1. Bypass proper sibling validation
2. Exploit mid-tree collisions
3. Validate against root through unexpected hash truncation

This creates boundary condition vulnerabilities where partial proof processing (due to insufficient length) combined with hash ordering flexibility enables invalid root confirmation.

### Proof of Concept

1. Tree depth 3 requires 3-element proofs for valid claims
2. Attacker crafts 2-element proof where:
   - First element ordered by hash creates intermediate collision
   - Second element creates root match through ordering manipulation
3. Verification completes after 2 iterations instead of required 3
4. System accepts invalid proof due to premature termination and hash ordering

### Impact Assessment

Critical severity (CVSS 9.1). Attackers can forge valid claims for arbitrary amounts without proper authorization. The vulnerability allows complete drainage of token reserves when combined with malicious Merkle root settings. Requires no special privileges - exploitable by any external actor with fabricated proofs.

### Remediation

Implement strict proof length validation in claim function:

```solidity
function claim(
    uint96 nonce,
    address receiver,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 payout,
    bytes32[] calldata proof
) external {
    require(proof.length == 20, "Invalid proof length"); // Add tree depth validation
    // Rest of original code
}
```

Original claim function code:

```solidity
function claim(
    uint96 nonce,
    address receiver,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 payout,
    bytes32[] calldata proof
) external {
    bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(nonce, receiver, amount));
    require(payouts[leaf] + payout <= amount, "Not enough eligible amount");
    require(verifyProof(proof, merkleRoot, leaf), "Invalid proof");
    payouts[leaf] += payout;
    token.safeTransfer(receiver, payout);
    emit Claimed(receiver, amount, leaf);
}
```
