## 📊 Vulnerability Statistics

- Total vulnerabilities found: 3

## 🚨 Issue 1

### 📄 File: `Airdrop.sol`

### Issue Code Highlight

```solidity
    constructor(address _token, uint256 _registrationDeadline, address _eligible) {
        token = IERC20(_token);
        registrationDeadline = _registrationDeadline;
        eligible = IEligible(_eligible);
        register();
    }
```

### Synopsis
Deployer can set registration deadline to current/expired timestamp during deployment, enabling instant registration closure and preventing legitimate participants from joining while preserving deployer's eligibility through constructor-invoked registration.

### Technical Details
The constructor fails to validate that `_registrationDeadline` is set to a future timestamp. When combined with the immediate `register()` call, this allows:
1. Deployer sets `registrationDeadline = block.timestamp` (current time)
2. Constructor's `register()` passes timestamp check (equal rather than future)
3. All subsequent registration attempts fail due to expired deadline
4. Participants array contains only deployer's address
5. Distribution phase becomes immediately available to deployer

### Proof of Concept
1. Deploy contract with `_registrationDeadline = block.timestamp`
2. Constructor executes `register()` - passes `block.timestamp <= deadline` check
3. Immediately after deployment (next block), attempt user registration:
```solidity
contract.register(); // Fails "Registration closed" 
```
4. Execute `distribute()` immediately - deployer receives all tokens

### Impact Assessment
Critical severity (CVSS:9.3). Allows deployer to: 
- Monopolize entire airdrop funds
- Freeze registration before contract becomes operational
- Force immediate token distribution post-deployment
Requires only normal deployer privileges. Permanent state corruption once deployed.

### Remediation
Add deadline validation in constructor:
```solidity
constructor(address _token, uint256 _registrationDeadline, address _eligible) {
    require(_registrationDeadline > block.timestamp, "Invalid deadline");
    // ... rest of constructor
}
```
This prevents deployment with non-future deadlines. Additional validation should be added to prevent extremely short registration periods if required.

## 🚨 Issue 2

### 📄 File: `Airdrop.sol`

### Issue Code Highlight

```solidity
    function register() public {
        require(block.timestamp <= registrationDeadline, "Registration closed");
        require(eligible.isEligible(msg.sender), "Not eligible");
        require(!registered[msg.sender], "Already registered");
        registered[msg.sender] = true;
        participants.push(msg.sender);
    }
```

### Synopsis

The registration process lacks maximum participant enforcement, allowing gas limit exhaustion during distribution that permanently locks all airdrop funds when participant count exceeds transaction processing capacity.

### Technical Details

The vulnerability stems from:
1. No cap on `participants` array size in registration function
2. Linear iteration over all participants during distribution
3. Block gas limit constraints for transaction execution

Attackers can exploit this by:
- Flooding with registrations (through Sybil attacks or eligibility abuse)
- Creating array sizes requiring more gas than block limit
- Making distribution transaction impossible to succeed

This violates the critical business requirement that distribution must be executable after registration closes. The highlighted code's missing participant cap enables denial-of-service through scale-induced failure.

### Proof of Concept

1. Attacker creates 10,000 eligible addresses (via compromised eligibility checks)
2. Registers all addresses before deadline
3. Contract accumulates 1,000,000 tokens
4. Owner attempts `distribute()`:
   - Requires 10,000 token transfers in one transaction
   - Exceeds 30M gas block limit after ~400 transfers (estimated)
5. Transaction fails repeatedly
6. All funds become permanently locked

### Impact Assessment

Critical severity (CVSS 9.1). Successful exploitation results in:
- Permanent loss of all airdrop funds
- Complete protocol failure
- Requires hard fork to recover
- Attack cost scales with eligibility system strength

### Remediation

Implement participant cap in registration:
```solidity
uint256 immutable public maxParticipants;

// In constructor:
require(_maxParticipants > 0, "Invalid max");
maxParticipants = _maxParticipants;

// In register():
require(participants.length < maxParticipants, "Participant limit reached");
```

Alternative: Convert to pull-based claims with individual participant withdrawals to avoid batch processing.

## 🚨 Issue 3

### 📄 File: `Airdrop.sol`

### Issue Code Highlight

```solidity
    function distribute() external {
        require(block.timestamp > registrationDeadline, "Distribution not started");
        require(!distributed, "Already distributed");
        uint256 totalParticipants = participants.length;
        require(totalParticipants > 0, "No participants");

        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 amountPerParticipant = balance / totalParticipants;

        distributed = true;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalParticipants; i++) {
            require(token.transfer(participants[i], amountPerParticipant), "Transfer failed");
        }
    }
```

### Synopsis

The distribution function allows execution with zero token balance, permanently locking any subsequent deposits by marking the airdrop as completed while distributing zero-value allocations to participants.

### Technical Details

The critical boundary condition occurs when the contract holds zero token balance during distribution:
1. `balance / totalParticipants` evaluates to 0 through integer division
2. Transfers of 0 tokens succeed for ERC20 implementations allowing zero-value transfers
3. `distributed` state flag becomes permanently true
4. Any tokens deposited to contract after this execution become irrecoverable

### Proof of Concept

1. Deploy contract without initial funding
2. Have 1 eligible participant register
3. Call `distribute()` after deadline
4. Contract balance = 0 → amountPerParticipant = 0
5. ERC20 contract permits 0-value transfer
6. `distributed` flag set to true despite no actual distribution
7. Subsequent token deposits to contract become permanently locked

### Impact Assessment

Critical severity (CVSS 9.1): Allows permanent loss of any tokens sent to contract after a zero-balance distribution. Attackers can trigger this accidentally or maliciously to create irreversible fund lockups. Requires no special privileges - inherent to contract logic.

### Remediation

Add balance validation before distribution:
```solidity
require(balance > 0, "No tokens to distribute");
```

Modified code section:
```solidity
uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
require(balance > 0, "No tokens to distribute");
uint256 amountPerParticipant = balance / totalParticipants;
```
