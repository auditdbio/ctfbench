## 🚨 Issue 1

### 📄 File: `SuperToken.sol`

### Issue Code Highlight

```solidity
    function _transfer(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _value
    ) private {
        require(_from != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from zero address");
        require(_to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to zero address");
        require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value, "ERC20: insufficient balance");
        uint256 balance_from = balanceOf[_from];
        uint256 balance_to = balanceOf[_to];
        balanceOf[_from] = balance_from - _value;
        balanceOf[_to] = balance_to + _value;
        emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    }
```

### Synopsis

Self-transfers enable balance inflation due to improper state updates. When `_from == _to`, the recipient balance calculation uses pre-update sender balance, enabling attackers to exponentially increase their token balance through repeated transfers to themselves.

### Technical Details

The vulnerability exists in the sequential balance updates:
1. `balance_to` is stored before modifying the sender's balance
2. When `_from == _to`, the recipient balance calculation uses the original pre-debit balance
3. Arithmetic operations effectively double the transfer value by:
   - First subtracting from sender balance
   - Then adding to recipient balance (same address) using original balance

For a self-transfer of value X:
1. Original balance: B
2. After sender update: B - X
3. Recipient update uses original B: B + X
4. Final balance becomes (B - X) + X = B + X

### Proof of Concept

1. User with 100 tokens calls `transfer(self_address, 100)`
2. _transfer executes:
   - balance_from = 100
   - balance_to = 100 (same address)
   - balanceOf[self] = 100 - 100 = 0 (temporary state)
   - balanceOf[self] = 100 + 100 = 200 (final state)
3. User repeats to get 400, 800 tokens, etc.

### Impact Assessment

Critical severity (CVSS 9.8):
- Allows infinite token minting through self-transfers
- Destroys token economics and contract trustworthiness
- Attack requires only 1 token to initialize
- All token holders lose value as attacker can dump inflated supply

### Remediation

Add self-transfer prevention in `transfer` function:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(msg.sender != _to, "ERC20: self-transfer forbidden");
    _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

## 🚨 Issue 2

### 📄 File: `SuperToken.sol`

### Issue Code Highlight

```solidity
    // Public transfer function
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }
```

### Synopsis
The transfer function permits self-transfers creating a balance inflation vulnerability. When transferring to self, flawed balance update logic in the internal _transfer function allows attackers to arbitrarily increase their token balance by repeatedly transferring to themselves.

### Technical Details
The vulnerability exists due to non-atomic state handling in self-transfers. When _from == _to:
1. `balance_from` captures pre-update sender balance
2. Balance is first subtracted then added back using original pre-update values
3. Final balance calculation becomes: `(original_balance - _value) + (original_balance + _value) = 2*original_balance`
4. This effectively doubles the balance on first transfer and creates exponential growth potential

### Proof of Concept
1. Attacker starts with 100 tokens (balance: 100)
2. Calls transfer(attacker_address, 100)
3. Post-transfer balance calculation:
   - balance_from = 100
   - balance_to = 100 (same address)
   - balanceOf[attacker] = 100 - 100 = 0 (temporary)
   - balanceOf[attacker] = 100 + 100 = 200 (final)
4. Repeat process to exponentially increase balance

### Impact Assessment
Critical severity (CVSS 9.3). Attackers can:
- Create infinite token supply through self-transfers
- Completely destabilize token economics
- Drain exchanges and liquidity pools
- Attack requires only standard ERC20 transfer functionality
- Permanent protocol destruction possible once exploited

### Remediation
Add explicit self-transfer check in the transfer function:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(_to != msg.sender, "Self-transfers forbidden");
    _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

Alternative: Fix balance calculation logic in _transfer function to use updated values when sender == receiver.
