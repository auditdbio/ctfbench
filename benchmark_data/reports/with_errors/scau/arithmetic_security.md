## Issue
**File:** Lending.sol


## Output

**SWC ID:** 104

**SWC ID:** 114  
**Severity:** Med  
**Line:** 87

### Description
Transaction Order Dependence (TOD): The order of transactions can affect the contract's state, especially in the `liquidate` function, where external calls might change the collateral value or debt status before it's called.

---

**SWC ID:** 106  
**Severity:** Low  
**Line:** 32

### Description
Unchecked response: The response from the `transferFrom` function of the token is unchecked and could potentially cause failures in `depositLiquidity`, `borrow`, `repayLoan`, and `liquidate` functions without being handled properly.

---

**SWC ID:** 128  
**Severity:** Low  
**Line:** 65

### Description
DoS With Revert: The use of `require` statements with external function calls can lead to denial of service by reverting transactions in `repayLoan` and `liquidate` functions.

---

**SWC ID:** 136  
**Severity:** Low  
**Line:** 82

### Description
Code With No Effects: The `}` at line 82 is not necessary and causes unintended function closure in the `repayLoan` function, affecting its logic and creating misleading code structure.
