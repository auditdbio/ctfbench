**SWC ID:** 107  
**Severity:** Med  
**Line:** 20

### Description
If the `target` is a contract whose fallback function reverts, the flash loan can never be executed, leading to DoS in `flashLoan` function. It's recommended to implement a fail-safe mechanism or properly document this risk.

The use of block timestamps as a source of entropy for randomness is not secure. Miners can influence the block timestamp, and using it for critical operations such as generating random numbers or other operations tied to future execution can be manipulated.
