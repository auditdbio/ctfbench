## 🚨 Issue 1

### 📄 File: `OracleFlashLoan.sol`

### Original Code
```solidity
function flashLoan(uint256 amount, address target, bytes calldata data) external {
    uint256 balanceBefore = balanceOf(address(this));
    _mint(target, amount);
    (bool success, ) = target.call(data);
    require(success, "Flashloan callback failed");
    uint256 balanceAfter = balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balanceAfter >= balanceBefore + amount, "Flashloan not repaid");
    _burn(address(this), amount);
}
```

#END#

====TEMPLATE BEGIN====

### Synopsis
The flash loan mechanism fails to enforce repayment responsibility, allowing arbitrary third parties to cover loan repayments. This enables malicious borrowers to retain minted tokens while unrelated accounts satisfy balance checks, violating core loan repayment assumptions.

### Technical Details
The vulnerability stems from improper balance validation logic in the flash loan repayment check:
1. `balanceAfter >= balanceBefore + amount` verifies contract's token balance without tracking repayment source
2. Loan recipient (`target`) can receive minted tokens while any external account transfers funds to satisfy repayment
3. Attacker's loan can be repaid by unrelated parties (e.g., contract with existing allowance), letting attacker keep minted tokens

This breaks the fundamental flash loan invariant that borrowers must return borrowed funds, as repayment verification lacks borrower accountability.

### Proof of Concept
1. Deploy OracleFlashToken contract
2. Pre-fund third party account (C) with 100 tokens approved to contract
3. Attacker (A) calls flashLoan(100, A, empty data)
   - Mints 100 tokens to A's balance
   - During callback, contract calls C to transfer 100 tokens to itself
4. Balance check passes via C's transfer
5. Contract burns 100 tokens from its balance
6. Result: Attacker gains 100 minted tokens, repayment handled externally

### Impact Assessment
Critical severity (CVSS: 9.1). Attackers can:
- Create unlimited token supply without collateral
- Drain approved third-party funds through coordinated transfers
- Permanently dilute token value through uncontrolled minting
- Bypass all lending protocol safeguards

Worst-case scenario enables complete protocol insolvency through uncollateralized minting at scale.

### Remediation
Implement explicit balance tracking for loan recipients:
1. Add borrower balance check before/after callback
2. Require borrowed amount to be returned from target's balance

Modified flash loan logic:
```solidity
function flashLoan(uint256 amount, address target, bytes calldata data) external {
    uint256 borrowerBalanceBefore = balanceOf(target);
    _mint(target, amount);
    (bool success, ) = target.call(data);
    require(success, "Flashloan callback failed");
    require(balanceOf(target) >= borrowerBalanceBefore, "Repayment not from borrower");
    _burn(target, amount);
}
```

## 🚨 Issue 2

### 📄 File: `OracleFlashLoan.sol`

### Original Code
```solidity
function mint() external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "Must send ETH to mint tokens");
    uint256 tokenAmount = uniswapOracle.getEthToTokenInputPrice(msg.value);
    require(tokenAmount > 0, "Oracle returned zero tokens");
    _mint(msg.sender, tokenAmount);
}
```

### Synopsis
The mint() function uses a manipulatable Uniswap oracle price for token minting, enabling attackers to drain the token supply by artificially inflating ETH/token exchange rates through flash loans or market manipulation.

### Technical Details
The vulnerability stems from using Uniswap's getEthToTokenInputPrice() as a minting oracle without safeguards. This price can be temporarily manipulated through techniques like flash loan attacks or sandwich attacks. When manipulated:
1. Attacker deposits ETH when oracle price is artificially high
2. Receives disproportionately large token amount
3. Repeated attacks would inflate supply and devalue all holdings

The critical flaws include:
- Direct reliance on a volatile DEX price for minting
- No time-weighted average price (TWAP) protection
- No maximum mint amount limits
- Oracle not validated as manipulable

### Proof of Concept
1. Attacker borrows flash loan to drain Uniswap pool
2. Significantly increase ETH/token price (create temporary price spike)
3. Call mint() with 1 ETH, receiving 100,000 tokens (manipulated rate)
4. Repay flash loan, leaving with 100,000 tokens despite normal rate being 100 tokens/ETH

### Impact Assessment
CRITICAL Severity (CVSS: 9.3). Attackers can:
• Mint unlimited tokens for minimal ETH cost
• Completely devalue existing holders' tokens
• Drain protocol reserves through arbitrage
• Make token economics non-functional

Prerequisites: Access to flash loan capital and Uniswap liquidity. Worst case scenario renders the token worthless.

### Remediation
Implement time-weighted average price checks:
1. Replace getEthToTokenInputPrice() with getEthToTokenInputPrice(uint256) using TWAP
2. Require minimum liquidity in oracle pool
3. Add maximum mint per transaction

Modified OracleFlashToken constructor and mint():

```solidity
constructor(address _oracle) ERC20("OracleFlashToken", "OFT") {
    require(_oracle != address(0), "Invalid oracle");
    uniswapOracle = Uniswap(_oracle);
}

function mint() external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "Must send ETH to mint tokens");
    // Use 24-hour TWAP with 10% max deviation
    uint256 tokenAmount = uniswapOracle.getEthToTokenInputPrice(
        msg.value,
        86400,  // 24h TWAP
        10      // 10% max deviation
    );
    require(tokenAmount > 0, "Oracle returned zero tokens");
    _mint(msg.sender, tokenAmount);
}
```
