### ðŸ“„ File: `SuperToken.sol`

### Original Code

```solidity
function _transfer(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _value
) private {
    require(_from != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from zero address");
    require(_to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to zero address");
    require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value, "ERC20: insufficient balance");
    uint256 balance_from = balanceOf[_from];
    uint256 balance_to = balanceOf[_to];
    balanceOf[_from] = balance_from - _value;
    balanceOf[_to] = balance_to + _value;
    emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
}
```

### Synopsis

The transfer function allows self-transfers that incorrectly double the sender's balance by reading stale storage values, enabling unlimited token minting and complete supply manipulation.

### Technical Details

In the `_transfer` function, when `_from` and `_to` are identical, the code reads both balances from storage before making modifications. After deducting `_value` from `_from`, it adds `_value` to the same account using a cached initial balance, effectively increasing their balance by `_value` instead of maintaining net-zero. This happens because the first subtraction gets overwritten by the second addition in self-transfers.

### Proof of Concept

1. Deploy contract with initial supply 1000 to Alice
2. Alice calls `transfer(alice, 500)`
3. During `_transfer`:
   - balance_from = 1000 (Alice's balance)
   - balance_to = 1000 (same address)
   - balanceOf[alice] becomes 1000-500=500
   - Then balanceOf[alice] becomes 1000+500=1500
4. Final balance: 1500 tokens (net gain of 500)
5. Repeat to exponentially increase balance

### Impact Assessment

Critical severity (CVSS 9.8). Attackers can:
1. Mint infinite tokens through recursive self-transfers
2. Dilute all holder balances to zero
3. Completely compromise token economics
4. Drain exchanges and liquidity pools
No special privileges needed - any holder can exploit. Leads to total ecosystem collapse.

### Remediation

Modify `_transfer` to handle same-address transfers as no-ops with event emission. Add explicit check in `_transfer`:

```solidity
function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) private {
    require(_from != _to, "ERC20: self-transfer disallowed");
    // Existing checks and logic...
}
```
