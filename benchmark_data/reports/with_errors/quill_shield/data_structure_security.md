# Vesting Smart Contract Security Analysis

## Issue
**File:** Vesting.sol


## Output

**Severity:** Low  

### Block timestamp

### Description
The static analysis report is correct in identifying the use of 'block.timestamp' for comparisons in the 'processRelease' function. The issue with using 'block.timestamp' in this context is that it can be manipulated by miners to a certain extent. Miners have some control over the timestamp of the blocks they mine, with the restriction that the timestamp cannot be more than 900 seconds in the future from the median timestamp of the previous 11 blocks. This can potentially be abused in a 'timestamp attack' to affect the outcome of time-dependent logic, such as releasing funds in this vesting contract.



```solidity
require(block.timestamp >= releaseTime[msg.sender], "Funds locked");
```

**Severity:** Low  

### Block timestamp

### Description
The smart contract uses 'block.timestamp' for comparisons when setting the 'releaseTime' for a user. This is a common practice, but it's important to note that 'block.timestamp' can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree, and it's also subject to the 15-second resolution of the Ethereum network. Using 'block.timestamp' for future time comparisons can lead to small inaccuracies, which may not be critical in all contexts, but could potentially be exploited in a financial contract like Vesting to gain a small advantage.


```solidity
if (releaseTime[msg.sender] == 0) {
```
